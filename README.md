# DigitalGuard: Secure Access Management for Modern Applications

DigitalGuard provides a robust and flexible framework for implementing secure access control within your applications. Leveraging cutting-edge TypeScript and modern authentication protocols, DigitalGuard empowers developers to enforce granular permissions, protect sensitive data, and streamline user management.

DigitalGuard is designed to address the growing need for sophisticated access control in today's complex software environments. Traditional role-based access control (RBAC) often falls short when dealing with fine-grained permissions and dynamic access requirements. DigitalGuard offers a policy-based approach, allowing administrators to define detailed rules that govern user access based on attributes, context, and resource properties. This enables the creation of truly personalized and secure user experiences. The framework is also built with scalability and extensibility in mind, making it suitable for both small-scale projects and large enterprise applications.

This project prioritizes developer experience by providing a well-documented API, clear TypeScript definitions, and comprehensive testing. We believe that security should not come at the cost of usability. DigitalGuard integrates seamlessly with popular authentication providers and provides a straightforward mechanism for defining and enforcing authorization policies. The modular architecture allows developers to customize the framework to fit their specific needs, while the built-in auditing and logging capabilities provide valuable insights into access patterns and potential security vulnerabilities.

DigitalGuard is not just another authorization library; it's a complete solution for building secure and compliant applications. It offers a blend of simplicity and power, allowing developers to focus on building innovative features without compromising on security. The flexible policy engine supports a wide range of access control scenarios, from simple user roles to complex multi-factor authorization workflows.

## Key Features

*   **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC):** Define granular access rules using a flexible policy engine that supports attribute-based access control (ABAC) and relationship-based access control (ReBAC). Access is determined based on the context and the attributes of the user, resource, and environment.
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** Written entirely in TypeScript, providing strong typing, improved code maintainability, and excellent IDE support. All APIs are fully typed and documented.
*   **Authentication Provider Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with popular authentication providers such as OAuth 2.0, JWT, and SAML. A pluggable authentication provider interface allows for easy integration with custom authentication systems.
*   **Fine-Grained Permissions:** Define precise permissions for each resource, allowing for granular control over user access. Permissions can be assigned to individual users, roles, or groups.
*   **Auditing and Logging:** Built-in auditing and logging capabilities provide a detailed record of all access attempts and policy decisions. This allows for easy monitoring, analysis, and compliance reporting.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Modular design allows developers to customize and extend the framework to meet their specific needs. Custom policy evaluators and data connectors can be easily added.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Support:** While primarily PBAC, DigitalGuard also supports traditional RBAC models. Roles can be defined and assigned to users, providing a simple and familiar way to manage access.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** Primary programming language, providing strong typing and enhanced code maintainability. TypeScript ensures type safety and improves the overall developer experience.
*   **Node.js:** Runtime environment for executing the DigitalGuard server-side components. Node.js provides a scalable and efficient platform for handling access control requests.
*   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building the DigitalGuard API endpoints.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for secure authentication and authorization. JWTs provide a standard and secure way to represent claims and exchange information between parties.
*   **[Choose a Database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]:** Data storage solution for storing user data, policies, and audit logs. The choice of database depends on your specific requirements and preferences.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You will also need a suitable database server, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/DigitalGuard.git

3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    cd DigitalGuard

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    npm install

    or

    yarn install

5.  **Configure the environment:** Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the necessary environment variables (see the Configuration section below).

6.  **Initialize the database:** Follow the instructions in the database documentation to create the necessary database schema and seed data.

7.  **Build the project:**

    npm run build

    or

    yarn build

8.  **Start the server:**

    npm start

    or

    yarn start

## Configuration

DigitalGuard relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root and populate it with the following variables:

*   `NODE_ENV`: The environment in which the application is running (e.g., `development`, `production`).
*   `PORT`: The port number on which the server will listen.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your database.  (e.g. `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`)
*   `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used to sign and verify JWTs. This should be a strong, randomly generated string.
*   `AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER`: The name of the authentication provider to use (e.g., `oauth2`, `jwt`, `saml`).
*   `OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for your OAuth 2.0 provider (if using OAuth 2.0).
*   `OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret for your OAuth 2.0 provider (if using OAuth 2.0).
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The level of logging to use (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).

## Usage

The DigitalGuard API provides endpoints for managing users, roles, policies, and resources.

**Example: Checking User Permission**

Let's say you want to check if a user has permission to `read` a resource called `document1`.

1.  **Authenticate the user:** Obtain a JWT token for the user from your authentication provider.

2.  **Send a request to the `/authorize` endpoint:**

    POST /authorize

    Headers:

    Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

    Body:

    {
      "resource": "document1",
      "permission": "read"
    }

    The API will return a JSON response indicating whether the user is authorized to perform the requested action:

    {
      "authorized": true/false,
      "reason": "Policy 'read_document' matched"
    }

Detailed API documentation, including endpoint specifications and request/response formats, will be provided as a separate document. This includes examples of creating users, assigning roles, and defining policies. The documentation will also cover more advanced topics such as attribute-based access control and relationship-based access control.
